THIS IS NOT A CHANGELOG. This log is to record stuff not captured by the code.

===Earlier===
- Setup system to use bag files
- After puzzling over why nodes were not subscribing to image topics, discovered ROS image_transport.

===28/1/2016===
- While running with turtlebot data for the first time, ran into this issue:
[http://answers.ros.org/question/221550/problem-running-rtabmap_ros-against-a-bag-file/]
and am now compiling rtabmap_ros from source in order to implement the linked fix.
- Compiled rtabmap 10.10 seems to *start* like before, now to patch in fix.
- Created git repo, initial commit to source control.
